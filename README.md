# Projects
The Projects are developed on FRDM-KL25z platform using C and Embedded C language.
In some modules, BeagleBone Black was also configured for build system and communicating with FRDM module via NRFL2401 module.
The IoT based Smart Plant Monitoring System is built by writing bare-metal firmware code for the EFM32 Leopard Gecko Board, which has an ARM Cortex M3 processor, ATMEL SAMB11 BLE board, as well as for interfacing external sensors like the SEN 13322 soil moisture sensor as well as TSL2561 Light sensor.
